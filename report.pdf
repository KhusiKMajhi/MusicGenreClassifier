# **Music Genre Classification & Mood-Based Recommendation System**

## 1. **Title Page**

* Project Title: *Music Genre Classification & Mood-Based Recommendation System*
* Your Name
* Supervisor/Guide Name (if applicable)
* Course / Department / College
* Date

## 2. **Abstract**

Write 4–5 sentences summarizing the project:

*Example:*

> This project focuses on classifying songs into genres using Machine Learning and recommending songs based on user mood. Audio features like MFCC, chroma, and spectral contrast are used to train a Random Forest classifier. The system maps genres to moods (Happy, Sad, Energetic, Calm, etc.) and provides personalized song recommendations. A Streamlit web interface is developed for interactive use, along with visualizations for genre distribution and feature importance. This project lays the foundation for an intelligent music recommendation system.

## 3. **Introduction**

* Background of music genre classification.
* Importance of mood-based recommendations.
* Overview of AI/ML in music analysis.

---

## 4. **Objective**

* Classify songs into genres using ML.
* Map genres to moods.
* Recommend songs based on mood.
* Provide visual insights (genre distribution, feature importance).

---

## 5. **Dataset**

* Name: GTZAN Music Genre Dataset
* Source: [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification)
* Description: 3-second audio feature CSV file (`features_3_sec.csv`)
* Features used: MFCC, chroma, spectral centroid, zero-crossing rate, etc.
* Labels: Genre (Pop, Rock, Jazz, Blues, Metal, etc.)

---

## 6. **Methodology**

### Step 1: Data Preprocessing

* Dropped non-feature columns (`filename`, `length`)
* Scaled features using `StandardScaler`
* Encoded labels using `LabelEncoder`

### Step 2: Model Training

* Model: Random Forest Classifier
* Train-test split: 80%-20%
* Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

### Step 3: Mood Mapping

* Mapped genres to moods:

  * Pop → Happy
  * Rock → Energetic
  * Blues → Sad
  * Jazz → Calm, etc.

### Step 4: Recommendation System

* Based on cosine similarity between feature vectors
* Top N songs recommended for the selected mood

### Step 5: Visualization

* Genre distribution
* Feature importance plots

---

## 7. **Implementation**

* Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, streamlit
* Streamlit app for interactive predictions and recommendations

---

## 8. **Results**

* Model accuracy: ~88%
* Confusion matrix shows performance across all genres
* Sample predictions and recommendations (insert tables/screenshots from Streamlit)
* Feature importance chart

---

## 9. **Discussion**

* Model performs well on most genres, slightly lower on country & rock.
* Recommendations are mood-aligned and relevant.
* Limitations: Only uses 3-second features, real-time audio upload not yet implemented.

---

## 10. **Future Work**

* Include 30-second features for improved accuracy
* Real-time audio feature extraction from uploaded songs
* Deploy on cloud for wider access
* Enhance recommendation system with playlists, ratings, and collaborative filtering

---

## 11. **Conclusion**

* Successfully classified music genres
* Mapped songs to moods
* Built a basic mood-based recommendation system
* Created an interactive web interface

---
